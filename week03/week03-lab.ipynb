    "3. Use the dot product to make predictions with a simple linear model — first for a single student, then for an entire dataset using matrix-vector multiplication\n",
    "4. Compute Mean Squared Error two ways (loop vs. vectorized) to evaluate model performance\n",
    "5. Visualize your results with a log-scale timing plot and a predicted-vs-actual scatter plot\n",
    "6. Solve shape puzzles that build the intuition you'll need to debug real matrix operation errors\n",

Does this necessarily mean that hours studied is the most important feature for predicting exam scores? Consider what you learned about standardization in Part 1 — how might the different scales of the features affect the weight values, and why might you want to standardize your data before comparing feature importance?"

Day after day they pour forth speech; night after night they reveal knowledge\"* (Psalm 19:1–2, NIV). In this lab you used linear algebra to uncover patterns hidden in raw numbers — relationships that aren't obvious until you compute them. In 3–5 sentences, reflect: How does the practice of finding patterns in data connect to the idea that creation reveals knowledge to those who look carefully? What responsibility do we have when the patterns we find (or miss) affect real people's lives?"
